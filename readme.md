## Problem statement 
To Develop an automated system for diagnosing plant diseases based on images, aiming to assist farmers in early detection and management of crop health issues. The system should accurately classify plant images into categories of healthy and diseased, providing real-time insights to farmers for timely intervention. By leveraging deep learning techniques with PyTorch, the goal is to create a robust and scalable solution capable of processing diverse plant images efficiently and effectively.

## About the project
The project involves developing a machine learning-based system using PyTorch to diagnose plant diseases from images. By utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system will classify images of plants into categories of healthy or diseased. This automated solution aims to assist farmers in identifying crop health issues early, enabling prompt action to mitigate potential losses. Through efficient preprocessing, model training, and deployment, the project seeks to provide an accessible and reliable tool for supporting agricultural decision-making.
